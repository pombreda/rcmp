Rcmp is a more flexible filecmp replacement.

The basic idea here is that depending on content, files don't have to
be bitwise identical in order to be equivalent or "close enough".
Rcmp includes a flexible extension structure to allow for a living set
of file comparisons.

See doc for more info.

To work with rcmp independently from bitbake, say, for instance, to
run the tests...

    svn co http://subversion.palm.com/main/nova/palm/rcmp/trunk
    cd trunk
    make check

The makefile sets up and uses a python standard "virtualenv".  To call
python directly, say, to run the debugger, you will need to set up
environment variables.  This is usually done using:

    . python-dev/bin/activate

Note that if you use emacs, you'll need to set this before you call
emacs.
