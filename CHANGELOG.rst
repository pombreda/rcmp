CHANGELOG
#########

v0.8
    - refactored a bunch of code in order to work within file
      descriptor and memory limits.
    - some profiling in order to chase down some inefficiencies, (like
      tarfile's pathological use of .tgz fles).
    - bzip2 and xz, (lzma), file support, (requires xz-utils library,
      liblzma-dev in debian)

v0.7
    - replace most tests
    - add command line wrapper
    - rework doc

v0.006
    - as open sourced by HP's osrb, sans tests
